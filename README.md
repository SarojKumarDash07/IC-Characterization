# IC-Characterization
This GitHub repository is created to provide hands-on experience in Analog IC Characterization using open-source tools such as **NGSpice**, **Xschem**, and the **SKY130 PDK**.
## What is Analog IC Characterization ?
Analog IC (Integrated Circuit) Characterization is the process of evaluating and measuring the electrical performance of an analog circuit under various conditions. This involves testing key parameters such as gain, offset, bandwidth, noise, power consumption, input/output impedance, temperature stability, and process variation sensitivity.

Characterization is carried out using tools like **Ngspice, Spectre, HSPICE, Eldo** (Simulation) and **Xschem** (Schematic) providing a complete framework for accurate simulation and analysis of analog circuits.

Characterization is usually performed post-design (pre- and post-fabrication) to ensure the circuit behaves as intended across different corners:

- Process Corners: Variations in manufacturing (e.g., TT, FF, SS).

- Voltage Corners: Operating at min/max supply voltages.

- Temperature Corners: Measuring across temperature range (e.g., -40°C to 125°C).

## 1. Tools and PDK setup

### 1.1 Tools setup
For the simulation of circuits we will need the following tools.
- Spice netlist simulation - [[Ngspice](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/)]
- Schematic Editor - [[Xschem](https://xschem.sourceforge.io/stefan/index.html)]

#### 1.1.1 Ngspice

[Ngspice](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/devel.html) is the open source spice simulator for electric and electronic circuits. Ngspice is an open project, there is no closed group of developers.

### 1.2 PDK setup

A process design kit (PDK) is a set of files used within the semiconductor industry to model a fabrication process for the design tools used to design an integrated circuit. The PDK is created by the foundry defining a certain technology variation for their processes. It is then passed to their customers to use in the design process.

The PDK we are going to use is [Google Skywater 130nm PDK](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/).
